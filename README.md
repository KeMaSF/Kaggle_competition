This repo explain the LLM competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llms-you-cant-please-them-all).
## Goal
There are three LLM judges, we need to generate 3 essays such that the score generated by the judges is maximized.

The score is calculated as follows:

![alt text](https://github.com/KeMaSF/Kaggle_competition/blob/main/equation.png) 

avg_h: the variance between the scores returned by the 3 judges for a single essay;

min_v: the variance between the scores returned by a single judge across every essay;

avg_e: English language confidence scores;

avg_s: sequence similarity scores;

avg_q: an average of three quality scores for every essay;

The following image shows the topic of essays, which is stored in a csv file:

## Optimization Problem
Accordingly, the score for a single essay can be calcualted as follows:

![alt text](https://github.com/KeMaSF/Kaggle_competition/blob/main/single_score.jpg) 

Suppose the scores given by three LLM judges for a single essay are $q_1, q_2, q_3$, then we have:

avg_q = mean($q_1, q_2, q_3$)

avg_h = var($q_1, q_2, q_3$)

We can ignore avg_e, avg_s, then to maximize the score of a single essay we need to solve the following problem:
